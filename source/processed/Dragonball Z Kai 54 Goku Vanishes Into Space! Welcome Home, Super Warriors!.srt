00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,989
Sure enough, there's no hope.

26
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,785
Damn it! Goku!

27
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,496
He really is dead, then?

28
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,583
What a shame.

29
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:53,548
We'll have to inform Goku's son
on Earth of his father's death.

30
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,299
This will be hard on him.

31
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,636
What if we have Bulma-san tell him?

32
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,847
All right.

33
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,349
Please, let me be the one to tell her.

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,810
Okay then, Yamucha.

35
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,399
Well then, if you would...

36
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,942
Right.

37
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,117
Bulma... Bulma, can you hear me?

38
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,120
Bulma...

39
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,666
Can you hear me, Bulma?

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,251
It's me, Yamucha.

41
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,879
Huh? Yamucha?

42
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,922
That's right. it's Yamucha.

43
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:39,176
I'm speaking directly into
your mind through Kaio-sama.

44
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,970
Into my mind?

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,263
Really?

46
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:47,476
What is it, Bulma-san?
By any chance, is that Kaio-sama?

47
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,980
That's what he said.
I'm impressed that you knew.

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,441
Yamucha is the one speaking right now.

49
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,484
So, are you doing well, Yamucha?

50
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,989
Mm-hmm. I am still dead,
but I'm doing fine, otherwise.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,868
But never mind me, I want you
to keep calm and listen to me.

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,537
It's about Goku.

53
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:11,334
Goku defeated Freeza. B-But then...

54
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:17,173
Hey, everyone, listen up! He says
that Son-kun has taken down Freeza!

55
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:22,178
Really, Bulma-san? Hooray! Hooray!

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,638
Hooray! Hooray!

57
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:28,100
<i>He has, huh? Son, you finally did it.</i>

58
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,188
Father has won! He won!

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>Freeza, beaten by Kakarrot?</i>

60
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,987
Be quiet and listen to me.
There's more than just that.

61
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,282
After he defeated Freeza, Goku...

62
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,326
...desperately tried to get away, but...

63
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,163
...he didn't make it before
Planet Namek exploded...

64
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,540
...and he died.

65
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,125
Hey, hold up, everyone.

66
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,504
He says that Son-kun died
when Planet Namek exploded.

67
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,422
That's a shocker, huh?

68
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,050
You dumb-ass! How can you put it like that?!

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,636
Think about Gohan, will you?!

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,222
Goku can never come back again!

71
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,434
You don't know what's what.

72
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,562
We have the Dragon Balls from Planet Namek.

73
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:18,484
The Dragon Balls came to Earth
together with the Namekians.

74
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,486
This will surprise you!

75
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,114
They say that the Namekian Dragon Balls

76
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:27,118
can bring people back
to life over and over again!

77
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,960
In other words, Son-kun,
Kuririn-kun, and Chaozu-kun

78
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,170
can all come back to life again.

79
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,006
I-Is that right?!

80
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,590
What is it, Yamucha?

81
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:46,595
We're all coming back to life!
Including you, Chaozu.

82
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,722
Really?

83
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,934
It's the folks on Earth who
don't know what's what.

84
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,229
Sure, Chaozu can be brought back to life

85
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,107
with the Namekian Dragon Balls.

86
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,818
But as for Goku and Kuririn...

87
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,487
What about Goku and Kuririn, Kaio-sama?

88
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:08,993
The Dragon Balls bring the dead
back to life where they died.

89
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,703
Which means...?

90
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,582
Goku and Kuririn would come
back to life on Planet Namek.

91
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,461
However, Planet Namek is no longer there!

92
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,799
It's now just the vacuum of space.

93
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,887
Death would be waiting for them
the moment they returned to life.

94
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,902
Kaio-sama, with your power,
can't you... can't you do anything?

95
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:48,365
I can do nothing. That place
is not under my jurisdiction.

96
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:56,290
H-He says that Son-kun... can't come back.

97
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,250
No-Oh, no...!

98
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:17,770
W-Why is it that Father and
Kuririn-san can't come home alive?

99
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,231
It sounds like if Kami-sama
regenerated your body,

100
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,482
like in Chaozu-kun's case,

101
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,568
and you're there at
Kaio-sama's place, you'd be fine,

102
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,531
but otherwise, you come back
to life wherever you died.

103
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:33,536
But Son-kun and Kuririn-kun
died on Planet Namek, and...

104
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,538
Planet Namek isn't there anymore, right?

105
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,832
It's just the vacuum of space.

106
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,918
What's more, apparently,
Kaio-sama isn't in charge

107
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,087
of the area where Planet Namek is.

108
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,297
No-Oh, no...

109
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,930
Why don't you try using
your heads for a minute?

110
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,099
You can just relocate their souls,

111
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,727
or whatever they are, here to Earth,
and then revive them, right?

112
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,146
More than likely.

113
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,189
Yeah! He's right!

114
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,151
That's a pretty good idea you had, isn't it?

115
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,656
Thank you very much.

116
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,953
Don't get carried away.

117
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,500
<i>I just want to see Kakarrot,</i>
<i>now that he's a Super Saiyan.</i>

118
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:26,130
<i>And then, someday, I'll beat him. I swear it!</i>

119
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,717
E-Excuse me, my earthling friend...

120
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,387
Once the Dragon Balls of Namek are restored,

121
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,599
we plan to locate a suitable
world and relocate there.

122
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,434
Could you direct us to a place

123
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,104
where we can spend our time until then?

124
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,564
Well, okay.

125
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,483
In that case, you can stay at my home.

126
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,444
Are you sure about that?

127
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,487
It's a huge place, so no problem.

128
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,951
Besides, we'd like to make use of
your Dragon Balls a little bit more.

129
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,289
Do it! Right, Dende-kun?

130
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,540
Sure...

131
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,251
if this many of you are
spotted loitering around,

132
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,545
it will create a huge uproar.

133
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,966
That's true enough.
Okay, we'll take you up on it.

134
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,635
How about you coming, too?

135
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,554
After all, you've got no hotel money, right?

136
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,723
I'll feed you plenty.

137
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,852
I'll bet you're just like Son-kun,
and eat like crazy, right?

138
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:27,483
But no matter how attractive I
might be, no hanky panky, okay?

139
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,820
V-Vulgar woman! Keep your voice down.

140
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,281
Okay, everyone, sit tight for a minute.

141
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,493
I'll go hunt down a phone
somewhere and have my dad come.

142
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,371
U-Um, Bulma-san...

143
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,416
Could I maybe stay over at
your place, too, Bulma-san?

144
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,627
Gohan-kun, you have your
own house, don't you?

145
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,131
You should go home. Your mother
must be worried about you.

146
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,509
Yeah, well, you see...

147
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,806
I forgot to do my homework...
and Mother will be angry with me.

148
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,981
Faster! Faster! Doesn't this
thing have more speed?!

149
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,816
Aw, geez...

150
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,860
Ah, he's here! He's here, he's here!

151
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,656
Here we are! Here! Here! Here we are!

152
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,333
Gohan-chan!

153
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,877
Where is Gohan-chan?!

154
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,131
Gohan-chan!

155
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,761
Mother, I'm home.

156
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:44,184
<i>And so, the Namekians were</i>
<i>taken to the Capsule Corporation.</i>

157
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,481
This is my home. What do you think?
Pretty cushy place, huh?

158
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,650
Is that...?

159
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:56,947
<i>And so, the Namekians ended</i>
<i>up staying at Bulma's home</i>

160
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,534
<i>until the Dragon Balls became reactivated.</i>

161
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,997
<i>And then, in no time at all,</i>
<i>130 days had passed.</i>

162
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,553
Wow. The Namekian Dragon Balls
reactivate after only 130 days, huh?

163
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,099
That's right. A Namekian
year is 130 days, after all.

164
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,936
That's about one-third of what
it is on Earth. Nice, isn't it?

165
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,731
Well, let's make our wishes to
Super Shen Long, right away.

166
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,984
J-Just a minute. Gohan isn't here yet.

167
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,528
Hey! Hold up a sec!

168
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,739
--Hey, Gohan!
--Hey, Gohan!

169
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,117
Sorry, my cram school ran a little long.

170
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,496
You're going to cram school
again? What a little trooper.

171
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,582
I want to have my Gohan-chan study like crazy,

172
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,752
so he'll end up becomin' a great scholar.

173
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,254
Well, we were just about to get started.

174
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,590
Okay, Dende-kun, if you please.

175
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,175
Right.

176
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,847
<i>Takkaraputo Poppolunga pupirito paro!</i>

177
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,198
Whoo! Whoo!

178
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,554
So this is the original Shen Long...

179
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,098
Wow, this is incredible!

180
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,724
Oh, my!

181
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,688
Thou who hast gathered
the seven Dragon Balls,

182
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,943
I shall grant thee any three wishes.

183
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,697
My earthling friend, we can go next time.

184
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,200
Go ahead and have your wishes granted.

185
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,287
Thank you very much, Grand Elder.

186
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,164
All right then, we'll make our wishes.

187
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,666
First, summon the souls
of Son Goku and Kuririn,

188
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,586
who died on Planet Namek, to come here.

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,882
<i>Napahito sonda bakuli lepicatto sopaletto!</i>

190
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,093
Understood. I shall try.

191
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,980
I have called hither the soul
of the one called Kuririn.

192
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,527
However, I cannot call forth the
soul of the one called Son Goku.

193
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,281
Huh? No-Oh, no! Why not?

194
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:50,954
Because Son Goku is alive.
I cannot call forth only his soul.

195
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,335
H-H-He's alive?

196
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,128
W-What?

197
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,547
H-He couldn't be. How?

198
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,925
--Yay! Yay!
--Yay! Yay!

199
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,177
Hooray!

200
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,849
If he's alive, I wonder why he hasn't come home.

201
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,311
His spaceship is probably
damaged or something.

202
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,982
Oh, in that case, you can ask
Polunga to summon him here.

203
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,943
Yeah, right!

204
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,569
Yay!

205
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,905
Okay then, first, the second wish.

206
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:30,202
--Go on! Go on!
--Bring Kuririn back to life.

207
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:35,457
<i>Papitto latonguge Kuririn barsatto!</i>

208
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,472
H-Huh?

209
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,558
Kuririn-san!

210
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,978
No-Oh, right. I've come back to life.

211
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,106
--Hooray!
--Yay! Yay!

212
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,525
As a special deal,

213
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,987
I have restored his dismembered
body to its original form.

214
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,366
You may have a stern face,
but you do good work, don't you?

215
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,161
Now then, finally,

216
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,498
pick up Son-kun and deliver him here!

217
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,042
--Hooray!
--Yay! Yay!

218
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:24,339
<i>Hirokelotto deliba milocasuta pippo!</i>

219
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,146
Goku-sa...

220
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,732
I cannot.

221
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,151
I have been denied.

222
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:52,576
The man named Son says that he
will return on his own in due time.

223
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,745
D-Denied? But why?

224
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,663
I know why!

225
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,708
He's afraid of his wife!
The strongest one in the universe

226
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,879
is Super Saiyan Son Goku's wife!

227
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,800
J-Joking! I'm joking!

228
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,970
F-Father isn't coming back?

229
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,223
He said he would come back
on his own in due time.

230
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,060
He's definitely coming home.

231
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,480
<i>I get it. He's training on another planet,</i>

232
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,441
<i>with plans to power up even more.</i>

233
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,486
<i>I can't just stick around here,</i>
<i>spinning my wheels!</i>

234
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,961
Oh, dear...

235
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,839
Pay him no mind.

236
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,175
Keep going. instead of Son,

237
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,470
bring back to life someone at Kaio's place.

238
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,808
Yeah, right. I wonder who we should ask for.

239
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,854
They say they want to call one of you back.

240
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,897
What should we do?

241
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,858
I want to train here for a little while longer.

242
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,778
I-I'd like to stay with Ten-san.

243
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,948
Okay then, Yamucha, you're the one to go.

244
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,953
Me first, huh? Sorry, guys.

245
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,746
All right. Well then...

246
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:23,125
Bulma... Bulma...

247
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,170
Bulma, it's me. Do you know who I am?

248
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,296
Kaio-sama?

249
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,633
Tenshinhan and Chaozu will be
staying over here a little longer.

250
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,261
Bring Yamucha back to life.

251
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,680
Yamucha, huh? Okay.

252
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,808
All right, the third wish. Once more, please!

253
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,893
Bring Yamucha back to life!

254
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>Pipatto dominori keludemine coalutto!</i>

255
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,609
All right, understood.

256
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:58,618
I have brought the man
called Yamucha back to life.

257
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,706
--Where? Huh? W-Where is he?
--Where? Where?

258
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,002
I have now granted all of thy wishes. Farewell!

259
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,296
J-Just a minute!

260
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:31,067
Aw, he's gone. Where is Yamucha?

261
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,903
Over here!

262
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,740
Ribbit-ribbit!

263
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,242
Yamucha-sama!

264
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,620
--Ribbit... ribbit...
--Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

265
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,330
Pu-erh...

266
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,873
Yamucha...

267
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,586
As long as you were going to bring me back,

268
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,422
I wish you could have picked a better spot.

269
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:03,600
<i>And so, another 130 days passed.</i>

270
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,897

--Ten-san! Ten-san!
--Chaozu...

275
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,509
<i>And then...</i>

276
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,596
Okay, Dende, it's time for us to take our leave.

277
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,139
R-Right.

278
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,810
Thank you very much, everyone.

279
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,440
T-Take care, okay?

280
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:57,279
Gohan-san, goodbye.
I've really enjoyed myself.

281
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,035
Dende...?

282
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,788
