2
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,395
K-Kaio-sama!

3
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,947
Are you all right?

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,650
Such tremendous power.

5
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:41,114
What's keeping him? What's keeping
Shen Long from granting that wish?

6
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,541
Come on, Shen Long.

7
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,667
By bringing back to life everyone
killed by Freeza and his men,

8
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,418
the Grand Elder will return to life,

9
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,922
and Planet Namek's Shen Long
should appear, as well.

10
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:59,723
There is no other way to save
Goku and the others now.

11
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,893
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

12
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,067
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

13
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:14,193
The Genki Dama bursts away

14
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,616
Go Go Let's do it

15
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:24,620
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

16
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,580
I won't hold back, just you watch

17
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:36,544
I'll protect you with my life

18
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:42,759
Turn your courage to love into strength

19
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:48,723
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

20
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:55,985
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

21
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,193
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

22
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,495
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

23
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:09,122
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

24
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,080
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

25
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,337
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

26
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:22,515
Your soul already knows the answer

27
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:26,219
Dragon Soul!

28
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:35,316
"Goku's Furious Roar!
Be in Time... A Wish of Resurrection!"

29
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,659
Father, hang in there.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,830
This is bad!

31
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,834
In a few minutes, this planet is
going to undergo a huge explosion!

32
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,884
Full powerll

33
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,641
What?!

34
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,294
Well? Take that!

35
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,667
There's no way the likes of
you could beat me, Freeza!

36
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,925
Father's... Father's Ki has vanished...

37
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,928
Huh? S-Son-kun is...

38
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,510
You don't think he's been done in, do you?

39
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,316
Bulma-san...

40
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,608
Please take Piccolo-san and
head on back to Earth without me.

41
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,435
H-Hold on!

42
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,654
Wait!

43
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,108
Gohan-kun!

44
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,945
I am my father's... Son Goku's son.

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,999
Now, I... l have to fight Freeza.

46
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,918
You can't! There's no way you can beat him!

47
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,669
I'm sure Piccolo-san would tell me to do it, too.

48
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,506
Bulma-san, take care.

49
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,716
There's only one thing I can do!

50
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,654
W-What is going on?

51
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,612
Have we come back to life?

52
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,698
Something is wrong here.
What is with this earthquake?

53
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,505
W-Where am I? Am I alive?

54
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,068
l was successful.

55
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,899
Those on Planet Namek who
were killed by Freeza and his men

56
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,155
live once again.

57
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,827
Good work.

58
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,701
And now, farewell!

59
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,462
Oh, he did it!

60
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,962
He did it! Everyone has come back to life!

61
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,713
And the all-important Grand Elder?

62
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,011
What about Planet Namek's Super Shen Long?

63
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,387
It's all right, it has to be
all right. The sky is dark.

64
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:57,597
The Super Shen Long is proof that
the Grand Elder came back to life.

65
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,148
l'll confirm it now.

66
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,565
The sky...? What is this?

67
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,739
Is this a sign that the
planet is about to explode?

68
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:12,320
It looks like I should get myself
away from this planet right away.

69
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,075
If I get caught in the middle of the explosion,

70
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,533
l'll lose a whole lot more of my strength.

71
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,500
W-What?!

72
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,921
What is this?

73
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,631
W-Why? Why am | back in mortality?

74
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,574
Good! Right according to plan!

75
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,907
Now, Kaio-sama, hurry!
Hurry and tell them the objective!

76
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,085
Right! The Grand Elder's
life is running out again!

77
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,458
I know.

78
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:10,260
Grand Elder of Planet Namek,
lam the Kaio of the Northern Galaxy.

79
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,929
Kaio-sama?

80
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,304
I want you to listen closely
to what I'm about to say.

81
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,559
Now, you will face me!

82
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,252
Do you think a maggot like you
can fight against me, Freeza?

83
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,957
How sad. You Saiyans can't help but fight,

84
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,463
even when you're outmatched.

85
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,508
Now...

86
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,308
You, who are the last Saiyan, come at me!

87
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,021
What do you think you're doing?

88
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,989
Why, you little...!

89
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,252
Now then, what sort of death would you like?

90
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:31,042
Ijust have to keep Freeza
busy for a few minutes...

91
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:36,221
By doing so, he'll be taken out
with this planet when it explodes...

92
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,523
I know. Ijust had a great idea.

93
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,897
I'll stick you in the same grave as your father.

94
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,657
Well? Aren't you happy? You should
be grateful for my benevolence.

95
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,711
All right, there's a little can-do spirit.

96
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,514
Just a little while... longer...

97
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:23,059
What the hell is he thinking?

98
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,933
So that's it!

99
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,316
| see what you're after now.

100
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,944
You're stalling for time.

101
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,616
Isn't that right?

102
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:46,158
You've realized that this world
will only last a short while longer.

103
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,585
Y-You...

104
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,587
You, who killed Father, and Kuririn-san...

105
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,885
I'm not going to let you go on living!

106
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,896
Masenko!!

107
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,535
That's more like it. It's no fun otherwise.

108
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,709
Pretty good going, for a maggot.

109
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:34,586
But I'm through playing around now.
I may as well let you see...

110
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:40,421
...me, at my 100-percent power,
like I was when I killed your father.

111
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,731
Father... Piccolo-san...

112
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,599
It's over.

113
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,196
What?

114
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,463
Father!

115
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,014
Why haven't you gotten away?!

116
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,387
I told you to get out of here!

117
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,889
B-But...

118
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,141
--Go on!
--Right.

119
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,893
Father...

120
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,781
You're a pest who doesn't know when to die!

121
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,735
If you would have just remained
dormant beneath the ground,

122
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,821
you could have shared
your fate with this planet.

123
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,706
You people from Earth are beyond foolish.

124
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,037
It's beyond the pale that
you should be so uppity

125
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,167
as to challenge me to battle.

126
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,250
It's your own swollen head
that's beyond the pale.

127
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,960
What?!

128
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,138
Fine. l'll blow you to bits.

129
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,685
Just like I did to that earthling.

130
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,936
Like you did to that earthling?

131
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,188
You mean Kuririn?

132
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,573
You mean Kuririn?!

133
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:02,568
Grand Elder of Planet Namek,
Namek could be annihilated at any moment.

134
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:07,117
You should have one wish
to the Dragon Balls remaining.

135
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,785
Y-Yes, Kaio-sama.

136
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,535
Ask your Shen Long immediately

137
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:17,836
to send everyone there,
except for Freeza, to Earth.

138
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:23,337
I understand, Kaio-sama.
lam grateful for your concern.

139
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:28,263
However, one must convey their
wishes to Shen Long directly.

140
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:32,012
I shall contact the one
closest to him, and relay your--

141
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,435
No, don't do that!

142
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,059
Change that wish!

143
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,812
Goku? Are you listening in?

144
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,643
What's this?

145
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,116
Don't make it everyone
there, except for Freeza--

146
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:52,913
change it to everyone there,
except for Freeza and myself!

147
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:58,289
Goku, I know how you feel,
but for now, you have to get to Earth.

148
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,430
If you don't let me settle
things here with Freeza now...

149
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,432
...I will hold it against you
for the rest of my life!

150
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,260
G-Goku!

151
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,687
Please, Kaio-sama!

152
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,850
But Goku...

153
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:26,154
Do it now! We ain't got any time left!

154
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,409
All right. Goku, I won't say another word.

155
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,663
Not if that's how badly you want this.

156
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,456
l was supposed to have been
killed by Freeza, so why...?

157
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:48,385
The one closest to him is Dende, is it?

158
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,132
This is the Grand Elder.

159
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,680
So then, you are all right?
But what in the world...

160
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:57,261
Ask questions later. I have
an urgent request for you.

161
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:02,566
Shen Long should be near you,
waiting for the final wish.

162
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,641
Yes.

163
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,695
It's true, we have only had
two of the wishes granted.

164
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:12,242
I want you to go to him at once,
and tell him the third wish.

165
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,990
Yes, sir. But what is it?

166
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,700
The third wish is that you want
to relocate everyone here,

167
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:25,005
except for Freeza and the Saiyan
named Son Goku, to Earth.

168
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,882
And Gohan-kun said that
we were all ready to launch...

169
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:37,217
Is he really serious about fighting Freeza?

170
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,896
He should just get Son-kun and
bring him back here right away.

171
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,479
I'm supposed to be dead.

172
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,357
Freeza saw to that.

173
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,905
Father...

174
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,666
Make sure you get back home alive, Goku.

175
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:06,372
Yeah. You know, you really racked
your brains on this one, Kaio-sama.

176
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,632
So that's the Shen Long of Planet Namek, huh?

177
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,964
Now I can fight you without
anything holding me back.

178
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,268
Th-That's what was coming
from the Dragon Balls!

179
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:29,353
But the Dragon Balls were
supposed to have turned to stone...!

180
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,312
Now's my chance!

181
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,567
Wait!

182
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,291
Do not interfere!

183
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,173
Where's Freeza? And Kakarrot?

184
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,260
Dende, it's up to you.

185
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,220
Please be in time.

186
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,525
Polunga!

187
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:25,371
Well? Have ye no other wish?

188
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,167
Y-Yes, I do!

189
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,714
If so, then speak it now!

190
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,889
Okay then, the third and final wish!

191
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,389
Make me, Freeza, immortal!

192
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,685
Oh, no!

193
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,148
Ah! Freeza!

194
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:51,898
Make me, Freeza, immortal!!

195
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,446
Poppolunga, Freeza pot Son Goku

196
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,276
pupirito lonlonpa papipupo paro!

197
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:06,367
Very well, understood.

198
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:12,707
I shall remove all others to Earth,
leaving these two behind.

199
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,796
Why, you little kid!

200
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,759
Freeza!

201
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,021
Vegeta...

202
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,405
Kakarrot! You finally became a Super Saiyan!

203
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,951
Y-You're here, too! Why?!

204
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,907
Why are you alive?!

205
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,493
Why, you...!

206
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,017
Farewell.

207
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,570
W-Wa it!

208
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,419
Apparently, you didn't get your wish granted

209
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,471
because you don't speak the language here.

210
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,389
That gave me a scare, too.

211
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,718
That was the kid that I killed, wasn't it?

212
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,145
They brought the folks
you guys killed back to life

213
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,393
using the Dragon Balls on Earth.

214
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,599
What?

215
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,858
And then, with the Dragon Balls here...

216
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,190
What was the wish that that kid had granted?!

217
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:05,118
He relocated everyone on this world to Earth,

218
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,696
with the exception of you and me!

219
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,671
The planet has started to contract.

220
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,508
There are probably only two
minutes before it explodes.

221
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:33,688
Will you be killed by me first,
or will the planet explode first?

222
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,312
Either way, since you can't
survive in the vacuum of space,

223
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,689
your only choice is to die.

224
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,819
Maybe. But I've been waiting for this moment.

225
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,994
The moment when just the two of us
can fight to our hearts' content.

226
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,868
Hmph, it sounds like you want to
settle the score with me, Freeza,

227
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,042
and you're prepared to give your life to do it.

228
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,222
Hand-to-hand combat, huh?

229
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,427
All right. You want to mix
it up that badly, do you?

230
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,142
Remaining on Planet Namek,
a world on the verge of dying,

231
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:24,105
Goku and Freeza are about to
engage in the ultimate slugfest!

232
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,033
Will they be able to reach a conclusion

233
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,701
before Planet Namek explodes?

234
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

235
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,413
Fly away into the boundless skies

236
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

237
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,463
and zip away to wherever we want

238
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,806
Being a daredevil is the best

239
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

240
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:57,101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

241
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:03,278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

242
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

243
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,865
You were born

244
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:16,575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

245
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

246
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,789
G0 at it full power

247
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,842
Hope is my weapon,

248
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,171
so believe in the future

249
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,640
Heya! I'm Goku!

250
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,392
Is that all you've got, Freeza?

251
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,598
W-What?

252
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,777
I asked you if that was all
you've got at your full power.

253
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:49,574
Why, you monkey! I am not about to lose!

254
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,616
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

255
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,788
"The Two Who Remain On a Vanishing Planet!
This is the Final Showdown. "

256
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,709
Let's finish this, Freeza!
