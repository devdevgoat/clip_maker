00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,799
Point 573-18220...

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,301
Then, right around here.

4
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,663
There is still some time
before Son Goku-san arrives.

5
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,786
I have plenty of drinks here,
so if you like, help yourselves.

6
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,453
I'll have something.

7
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,255
--Me, too.
--H-Hey, Gohan...

8
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,175
I'll have something here.
Let's see, which will it be...?

9
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,629
Huh? Do we have these in our product line?

10
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,216
Wow, this is delicious!

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,766
Yeah, you're right.

12
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,391
Maybe I'll have something, too.

13
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,312
Have we ever met anywhere before?

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,812
Eh? N-No, not really.

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,735
How do you know my father?

16
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,861
I've only ever heard stories
about him. I haven't met him yet.

17
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:20,285
So, how do you know that Goku
will be coming here in three hours?

18
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,657
W-Well...

19
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,865
...|'m sorry, I cannot say.

20
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,120
What do you mean, you can't say?

21
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,170
Who the hell are you? How did
you get that kind of power?

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,632
Um, when you defeated
Freeza and the other one,

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,005
you were a Super Saiyan, weren't you?

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,303
Uh, y-yes, I was.

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,971
Get real!

26
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,049
The Saiyans consist of me and Kakarrot,

27
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,681
who goes by the name Son Goku here on Earth,

28
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,139
and the earthling half-breed kid there.

29
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,144
There aren't any others left besides us three!

30
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,851
So there's no way you can be a Saiyan!

31
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,522
B-But the fact remains,

32
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:00,735
he actually did turn Super Saiyan,
and he defeated Freeza.

33
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,242
And Saiyans are supposed to all have black hair.

34
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,960
Huh? Say, that's our Capsule
Corporation logo, isn't it?

35
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,208
How come? Are you one of our employees?

36
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,665
N-No, it's not like that.

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,296
That's a secret, too?

38
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,674
So are your name and age confidential, as well?

39
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:24,099
I cannot tell you my name,
but lam 17 years old.

40
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,972
Odd that he won't tell us his name.

41
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,645
Yeah. There's no reason for him to hide it.

42
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,766
Say, let's stop asking him questions.

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,145
He's getting flustered, you know.

44
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:36,729
This boy just saved us, and the whole Earth.

45
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,908
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

46
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,082
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

47
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,208
The Genki Dama bursts away

48
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,631
Go Go Let's do it

49
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:03,636
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

50
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:09,561
I won't hold back, just you watch

51
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:15,518
I'Il protect you with my life

52
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:21,733
Turn your courage to love into strength

53
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:27,743
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

54
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:35,001
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

55
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,208
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

56
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,511
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

57
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,138
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

58
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,061
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

59
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,311
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

60
00:03:54,401 --> 00:04:01,489
Your soul already knows the answer

61
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,193
Dragon Soul!

62
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:14,748
”Welcome Back, Son Goku!
Confessions of the Mysterious Youth, Trunks. ”

63
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,405
Um, Piccolo-san,

64
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,199
there's something I've wanted
to ask you for a while now...

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,196
What is it?

66
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,404
A year ago, when Dende-kun
and the others from Planet Namek

67
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,706
relocated to another planet,

68
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:57,127
why didn't you go with
everyone else, Piccolo-san?

69
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,375
No earth-shattering reason.

70
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,708
It's because I couldn't take that
boring life, with no stimulation.

71
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,842
So then, even now, you're spending
every day in intensive training?

72
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,297
You got it.

73
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,475
Vegeta is gone all day long, too.

74
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,177
I'm sure he's off training somewhere.

75
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,811
Yeah. I bet even now, he's still
thinking of defeating Goku.

76
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,518
The guy has an incredible amount of pride.

77
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,400
I hear he was once the Saiyan prince.

78
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,731
Don't you think they look alike?

79
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,111
Who?

80
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,067
That mysterious boy and Vegeta.

81
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,074
Look, there's just something about them.

82
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,248
I don't know, maybe they're a little alike.

83
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,327
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

84
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:42,631
If you really are a Saiyan,
I can't be anything new, right?

85
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,004
l-l'm sorry.

86
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:50,590
He came to know Son Goku
on some planet out in space.

87
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,675
Would that be so hard to imagine?

88
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,227
But he seems to be right at home here on Earth.

89
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,311
Three hours have passed.

90
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,109
Son Goku-san should be
arriving any moment now.

91
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,777
R-Really?

92
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,735
H-He's right!

93
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,532
I sense it! I sense a Ki!

94
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,870
Something is definitely coming.

95
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:16,199
Th-Then, the time and place that boy
told us were right on the money?

96
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,246
It's Father! It's Father's Ki!

97
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,003
He's here!

98
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,224
--Over there!
--W-Wait up!

99
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,180
Wait up, I say!

100
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,560
H-Hold on!

101
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,110
Down there!

102
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,174
--Huh?
--Hooray!

103
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,967
--Father!
--Goku!

104
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,762
What are you guys doing here?

105
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,805
Welcome home, Father!

106
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,804
Hooray! Hooray!

107
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,635
Hooray!

108
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,473
How did you guys know
I would be landing here?

109
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,312
This boy, this boy! He told us
you would be coming back here!

110
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,068
Father, you know who he is, right?

111
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,905
No, who is he?

112
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,658
You mean, you don't know who he is at all?

113
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,580
Nope, I don't know him at all.

114
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,456
He knew that you'd be coming
here right at this time, Son-kun.

115
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:49,042
Really? That's strange. Freeza
and them detected my spaceship,

116
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,424
and it looked like they knew
when l was gonna arrive on Earth.

117
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,347
l have to wonder, though: who was
it who defeated Freeza and them?

118
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,140
That was an amazing Ki! Was it you, Piccolo?

119
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,809
Or was it you, Vegeta?

120
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,308
He's the one who dealt
with Freeza and the others.

121
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,185
In the blink of an eye, at that.

122
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:07,689
And he can turn Super Saiyan, like you do.

123
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,895
Super Saiyan?

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,158
Wow, that's amazing! And you're so young, too.

125
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,329
l have to say, I didn't know there
were any other Saiyans besides us.

126
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,079
You're wrong! There are definitely
no other Saiyans besides us!

127
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,707
Well, I guess it don't really matter.

128
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,916
Yes, it does matter.
You're just as carefree as ever.

129
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,093
lam?

130
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,590
Son-san...

131
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,763
I actually need a word with you.

132
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,930
With me?

133
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,225
Yes. Just the two of us.

134
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,102
All right.

135
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,681
What, this is confidential from the rest of us?

136
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,232
Sorry, guys. Wait here for a little bit.

137
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,734
Here should be good.

138
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,282
Come to think of it, | forgot my manners.

139
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,111
Thanks for defeating Freeza for me.

140
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,912
Sure enough, I guess I went too easy on him.

141
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,990
You were actually supposed to be the one

142
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,665
who defeated Freeza and the others,

143
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,289
but there was some discrepancy, time-wise,

144
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,915
and for whatever reason, you couldn't.

145
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,371
So I didn't have any other choice.

146
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:14,506
Yeah. Freeza's spaceship was faster,
and he got ahead of me.

147
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,507
Looks like he ain't learned his lesson one bit,

148
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,213
and when l was about to get him...

149
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,050
There were still three hours before your arrival,

150
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,680
so you wouldn't have made it.

151
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,233
A new move?

152
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,354
Yeah. It's something called
Instantaneous Movement.

153
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,651
l-lnstantaneous Movement?

154
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,901
The folks on a planet called
Yardrat taught it to me.

155
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,653
I could move from the spaceship I was in

156
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,030
to where Freeza was in an instant.

157
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,453
l-ls that right?

158
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,953
Son-san, I didn't know that
you had acquired that skill,

159
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:50,253
so I thought that it would take you
three hours to arrive by spaceship.

160
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,548
I've changed history for no reason.

161
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,626
As a result, I ran into everyone else

162
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,678
when I only intended to see you, Son-san.

163
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,598
History? What do you mean?

164
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,051
Before I get into that,
I have something to ask you.

165
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:09,230
Son-san, are you able to freely
turn Super Saiyan at will?

166
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,354
Yeah. I couldn't do it at first,
but I worked hard at it,

167
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,731
and now I'm able to control it.

168
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,691
Would you turn here, now, for me?

169
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,286
If you please?

170
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,164
All right.

171
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,683
H-He turned Super Saiyan!

172
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,775
Is this okay?

173
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,818
Thank you very much.

174
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:00,194
I'm surprised. You look just like
I do when I turn Super Saiyan.

175
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,025
So, now what do we do?

176
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,657
I will turn Super Saiyan, as well.

177
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,373
Damn it!

178
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,888
We really do look alike.

179
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,718
Please excuse me.

180
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,229
W-Why did you not move out of the way?

181
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,067
Because you had no bloodlust.
I knew you would stop short.

182
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,952
| see.

183
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,997
Well then, this time, I will not stop. Ready?

184
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,665
All right.

185
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,396
Impressive. The stories I've heard
are true. No, you're even better.

186
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,657
This is the sword that I used to slice up Freeza.

187
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,951
That's just because you
weren't trying very hard.

188
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,415
I am able to place my trust in you.

189
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,080
I will tell you everything.

190
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,748
D-Did you see that?

191
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,703
Yeah. Get a load of those guys!

192
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,630
Please keep everything I'm about to tell you

193
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,049
locked away within your mind alone.

194
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:46,471
All right. Relax and speak freely.
I'm the tight-lipped type.

195
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:51,348
I came here in a time machine,
from roughly 20 years in the future.

196
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,271
Th-The future?! Twenty years?!

197
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,814
Yes. My name is Trunks.

198
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,109
The reason why I carry Saiyan blood

199
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,688
is because I am the son
of Vegeta-san over there.

200
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,617
Y-You're really Vegeta's son?!

201
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,571
Now that you mention it,
there is a resemblance.

202
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,658
He's your old man, huh?

203
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,209
I was born two years from now.

204
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,913
Wow, I'm stunned.

205
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:24,377
But I did not come here in the
time machine to tell you that.

206
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,133
There is something very important
that I would like you to know.

207
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,633
O-Okay.

208
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:34,391
In three years from this time,
on May 12th, at about 10:00 a.m.,

209
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,473
on an island about 9 kilos
southwest of Metro South,

210
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,024
a fearsome duo is going to appear.

211
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,811
They will be monsters, possessing powers

212
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,569
unthinkable for anything of this world.

213
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,945
Who are they? Aliens?

214
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:53,201
No. They are Artificial Humans,
born of this Earth--

215
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,782
otherwise known as cyborgs.

216
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,037
The one who created them

217
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:02,543
was a former mad scientist of
the Red Ribbon Army, Doctor Gero.

218
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,798
Red Ribbon Army? You mean the
Red Ribbon Army that I wiped out?

219
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,378
Correct.

220
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:13,137
The army itself was crushed by you, long ago.

221
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:17,597
However, Doctor Gero survived,
and continued his research.

222
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,486
For what reason? Was the usual
"world domination" his goal?

223
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,278
I don't really know for sure,

224
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,984
but I think that's what
Doctor Gero was after, at least.

225
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,241
But the Artificial Humans he created

226
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,572
as the ultimate killing machines...

227
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:43,084
...ended up killing Doctor Gero,
the one who gave them life.

228
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,710
Which is to say, the Artificial Humans,

229
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,091
who delight in nothing but
slaughter and destruction,

230
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,218
were all that remained.

231
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,893
If you, the Super Saiyan who
killed Freeza in the blink of an eye,

232
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,689
call these things monsters,
they must really be something.

233
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,232
Yes. I have faced off against them,

234
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,561
but unfortunately, since there were two of them,

235
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,068
even one-on-one, it was all
I could do just to get away.

236
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,570
Hold on. If there's two of them,

237
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,197
who else is on your side?

238
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,869
No one.

239
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:19,416
20 years from now, I am
the only warrior remaining.

240
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,118
In the battle three years
from now, my father, Vegeta,

241
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,955
Kuririn-san, Yamucha-san, Tenshinhan-san,

242
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,789
Chaozu-san, Piccolo-san...

243
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,840
...all got killed.

244
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,840
Son Gohan-san barely escaped with his life.

245
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:37,096
Gohan-san was the teacher
who taught me how to fight,

246
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,723
until, four years ago...

247
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,977
As you are aware, with Piccolo-san dead,

248
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,648
the Dragon Balls are gone, as well,

249
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,694
and no one was able to come back to life.

250
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,823
They're too strong! They're just too strong!

251
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,037
Hold on! What about me?
What happened to me?

252
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,612
Did they get me, too?

253
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,494
You did not fight.

254
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,874
A short time from now,
you will be stricken with an illness.

255
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,829
You will then die from it.

256
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,840
It is a viral heart disease.

257
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,966
Not even a Super Saiyan
could beat out this illness.

258
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,595
What a bummer. Not even senzu
beans work against this illness?

259
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,801
Damn, I'm gonna die, huh?

260
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,434
Aw, man, I want to fight these guys!

261
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,108
Do you really regret not being able to fight?

262
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,901
Have you no fear?

263
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,649
Sure I'm afraid.

264
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,028
These guys are crazy strong, right?
I wanna give them a shot!

265
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,861
You truly are a genuine Saiyan warrior.

266
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,618
Exactly the sort of man my mom
and Gohan-san said you were.

267
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,872
When the symptoms appear, take this.

268
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,042
What is it?

269
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,622
Your medicine. It is an
incurable disease in this era,

270
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,424
but in 20 years, there is a wonder drug for it.

271
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,878
With that medicine, you will
be able to pull through.

272
00:16:54,972 --> 00:17:01,013
Really? Hooray! Geez, why didn't
you say so in the first place?!

273
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:06,644
The truth is, it's wrong for me to
do this-- change history like this.

274
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,816
But given the history that it is...

275
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,612
I have faith that you will
be able to do something.

276
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,532
That's all my mom hoped for, as well,

277
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,031
as she worked so hard to finally
complete the time machine.

278
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,578
H-Hold on a minute.

279
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:26,535
Sh-She made your time machine?
D-Don't tell me your mommy is...

280
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,665
Yes, right over there.

281
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,041
B-Bulma?!

282
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,469
How long are they going to gab?!
This is getting on my nerves!

283
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,468
It looks like Son-kun just fell over from surprise.

284
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,642
Wow, that's the most surprising thing of all!

285
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,062
I thought for sure that Bulma
would settle down with Yamucha,

286
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,232
but Vegeta, of all people...

287
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,936
Apparently, um, she got fed up
with Yamucha-san two-timing her,

288
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,316
and they broke up.

289
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,698
Oh, what's the matter?

290
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,697
When she did, she saw my
father looking so lonesome,

291
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,120
and apparently, it was a
spur-of-the-moment thing.

292
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,826
But they never got married, my mom
being the way she is, and all...

293
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,911
Wow, I had no idea.

294
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:14,045
Well, that does sound like her,
now that you mention it.

295
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:18,754
My father died before I could remember him,

296
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,590
so I was thrilled to meet him
for the first time earlier.

297
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,845
It looks like he's looking over here.

298
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,427
It kind of looks like he's smiling.

299
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:31,482
Um, please keep that part
especially secret, okay?

300
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,151
If you say anything, and things
get awkward between them,

301
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,480
then my very existence will be wiped out.

302
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,816
Yeah, I got it, I got it!

303
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:43,074
Well, I will excuse myself now.

304
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,156
I'd like to hurry back and
reassure my mom in the future.

305
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,868
Yeah. Tell her thanks a bunch for this!

306
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,294
I sure hope that future is changed.

307
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:57,091
Right. Knowing your strength,
Goku-san, I now have a little hope.

308
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,588
Will I ever see you again?

309
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,592
I don't know. It takes a long time
to obtain the energy required

310
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,174
for the time machine to make a round trip.

311
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,683
If I'm still alive after that,
I'll definitely come to help.

312
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,311
Three years from now.

313
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,393
You stay alive. You've got a good objective.

314
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:20,073
I'll train good and hard for these
three years, with that in mind.

315
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,195
Hey, he's taking off!

316
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,165
Now then, what do I do?

317
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,209
I wonder how I'm gonna
explain this to everyone.

318
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,036
Father!

319
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,122
Goku, what did he say?

320
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,502
Ah, er, well...

321
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,754
...it ain't anything that important.

322
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,930
Start talking. This is something
very important for all of us.

323
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,928
Piccolo, you could hear us?

324
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,762
My sense of hearing is a little
different from the rest of you.

325
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,893
What's so important?

326
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,099
Tell us.

327
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,184
Uh, w—well...

328
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,112
If it's too hard for you to do it, I'll tell them.

329
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,813
Y-Yeah, but...!

330
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:05,322
Don't worry. I won't say anything
that would wipe out his existence.

331
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,904
But we shouldn't have to get killed

332
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,160
because we didn't do any decent training.

333
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,163
Piccolo told the others everything,

334
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:18,374
while managing to leave the
mystery about Trunks intact.

335
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:24,133
As might be expected, no one
was able to conceal their shock.

336
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,260
I-It kind of sounds far-fetched, doesn't it?

337
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,602
A time machine?

338
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,679
If you don't want to believe it,
then fine. Go ahead and goof off.

339
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,140
I'm going to train. I don't want to die, after all.

340
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,478
W-What's that?

341
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,824
Dad, you are the strong, proud, stern,

342
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:53,454
as well as lonesome, man
that Mom said you were.

343
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,580
Please don't die.

344
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,287
Young Mom, you hang in there, too.

345
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,513
I-I'm going to train.

346
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,387
I will, too.

347
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:16,269
Damn it! I am definitely going
to survive in three years!

348
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,850
After delivering the bombshell news,

349
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,312
the mysterious youth departed.

350
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:29,869
Will there really be a fearsome pair
that appears in three years?

351
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,956
Flap your wings ever more mightily,

352
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,004
ever more swiftly

353
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,504
Once someone starts running,

354
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,587
they can even fly through the air

355
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,174
Just ride along on the winds of courage

356
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,307
that start blowing within your heart

357
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,014
and before you know it,

358
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,818
your body will start to float

359
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:09,242
The drive you have to try will be your wings

360
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,034
Flap your wings ever more mightily,

361
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,037
ever more swiftly

362
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,416
Anyone who kicks off from the ground

363
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:25,125
can even fly through the air

364
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,101
Heya! I'm Goku!

365
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,351
So these Artificial Human monsters
are gonna show up in three years?

366
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,228
With that established,
let's knuckle down and get training!

367
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:46,062
Don't get too cocky, Kakarrot!
Iswear, someday, I will surpass you!

368
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,398
Yeah. I'm gonna get a
whole bunch stronger, too.

369
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,278
I'm looking forward to it!

370
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,075
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

371
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:56,281
"Goku's New Move, Instantaneous Movement!
Special Training for Three Years Hence. "

372
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,742
I will go beyond even Super Saiyan!
