00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,703
Goku and Freeza alone remain on Planet Namek,

3
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:09,586
which is mere moments from annihilation.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,927
I've been waiting for this moment.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,053
The moment when just the two of us
can fight to our hearts' content.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,806
Hmph, it sounds like you want to
settle the score with me, Freeza,

7
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,979
no matter what.

Bulma-san!

00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,836
G-Gohan-kun...

28
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:22,344
Gohan-kun, what was the big idea,
making me wait all that time alone?

29
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,425
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,852
Where exactly are we?

31
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,555
It doesn't appear to be Planet Namek.

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,437
l was aboard the spaceship.

33
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,361
I don't see the spaceship around here.

34
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,081
l-lt's you...

35
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,461
Where are we?

36
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,379
Son!

37
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,582
Piccolo-san!

38
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,920
--Gohan...
--Piccolo-san! Ah, Dende!

39
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,345
Am I dreaming?

40
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,297
Ow! This isn't a dream!

41
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:08,181
It looks like I've come back to life.

42
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,058
Then, has Kuririn-san, too?

43
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,558
I don't know.

44
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,561
Yeah, I guess not.

45
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,688
G-Grand Elder!

46
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,815
Grand Elder?

47
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,365
One way or another, you're going
to be dead in a few minutes.

48
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,245
You poor, pathetic creature.

49
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,669
You're the pathetic one.
After all, you're the one

50
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,169
who's about to be beaten by a
detestable, simian Saiyan bastard.

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,127
Hmph, it doesn't matter how
much bravado you put forth.

52
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:46,215
I'm the one who will be
watching this planet explode!

53
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:32,310
Everyone, this is the planet Earth.

54
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,015
--Earth?!
--|-|t can't be! How?

55
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,521
What has happened here?

56
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:43,402
My time is short, and I will
once again be called away.

57
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,982
But before I die,

58
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:50,322
I would like to relate to you
what has just happened to us.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,959
Where have Kakarrot and
Freeza disappeared to?

60
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:26,945
Then, Father is still fighting
Freeza on Planet Namek?

61
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,200
Grand Elder, do you know what
has become of Planet Namek?

62
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,956
Unfortunately, I am no longer
aware of the happenings on Namek.

63
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,667
O-Oh, no...

64
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,793
Son will be fine.

65
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,213
Piccolo-san...

66
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,920
Of course he'll be fine.

67
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,132
P-Piccolo-san...

68
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,141
Father...

69
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,316
Son-kun, don't you die.

70
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,232
Son...

71
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:17,701
Father”

72
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,172
Hmph! There's no way I
can lose to some monkey!

73
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,179
Not to a mere Saiyan monkey!

74
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,195
Goku! Goku!

75
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,273
Kaio-sama, what is happening?

76
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:54,987
Th-They're evenly-matched. Goku is
fighting toe-to-toe against Freeza.

77
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,666
But there's no time left
before Planet Namek explodes.

78
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,333
If their fight keeps going like this,

79
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,376
it will play right into Freeza's hands.

80
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,876
How exactly do you mean?

81
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,379
When Planet Namek is destroyed, Goku will die.

82
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,681
However, Freeza will survive.
He is able to live in any environment.

83
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,931
Kaio-sama, isn't there any way to save Goku?

84
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,478
This is the path that Goku chose for himself.

85
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,647
O-Oh, no...

86
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,023
--Yamucha!
--Goku!

87
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,612
S-Son...

88
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:47,381
How do you like this?! I will not
be beaten by an inferior Saiyan!

89
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,881
Not by a lowly Saiyan!

90
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,902
You monkey!!

91
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,718
What are you doing, Bulma-san?

92
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,641
A little botanomancy. I learned
how to do this when I was a child.

93
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,523
To pray for the safe return of a traveler,

94
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,072
you put three leaves inside
a circle and burn them.

95
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,865
They say that if the leaves all burn up,

96
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,659
the traveler will come home safely.

97
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,285
Oh, and you're divining Goku's fate, right?

98
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,470
Look, they're burning!

99
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,468
I'm sure they'll all burn up.

100
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,266
Goku-san will be coming home, right?

101
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:26,222
Yeah! This kind of
fortune-telling is always right!

102
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,771
Fortune-telling is a bunch of baloney!

103
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,948
Father is definitely coming home!

104
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,947
Yeah, you're right!

105
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:44,372
Father is going to beat Freeza
and come home for sure!

106
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,267
How about that, you simian bastard?

107
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,474
Is that all you've got?

108
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,355
What?

109
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,277
| asked you if that was all you've got.

110
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,822
H-How insolent!

111
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,388
You simian bastard!

112
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,067
You're just a lowly Saiyan!

113
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,518
D-Damn it...

114
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:41,652
I'll pay you back for this tenfold--
no, a hundredfold!

115
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,393
--|'m calling it.
--W-What?

116
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,535
W-What do you mean, you're calling it?

117
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,743
The backlash from you using
your 100-percent power

118
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,328
has you past your peak,
and your Ki is dropping in a hurry.

119
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,086
I'm beginning to think there ain't
no reason to fight you no further.

120
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:50,967
I'm satisfied. Your pride is already in tatters.

121
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,764
After all, someone showed
up who surpassed you--

122
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,264
something you thought no one
in the world could ever do.

123
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,971
What's more, he turned out to be...

124
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,057
...a "lowly Saiyan."

125
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,518
Now that you're this spooked,
there ain't no point in defeating you.

126
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,856
You should go on living with
that shock, quietly, in obscurity.

127
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,782
I'm going home to Earth.

128
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,861
If I leave now, I should
still barely make it in time.

129
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,579
Freeza, don't you ever cause any trouble again.

130
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,290
I don't ever wanna see your face again.

131
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,219
Don't you screw around...

132
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,843
Don't you screw around with me!

133
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,220
l-l'm not...

134
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,306
I'm not...

135
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,152
...beaten!!

136
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,494
You're a complete and utter fool!

137
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,127
I gave you one last chance!

138
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,936
Freeza!!

139
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,661
That will follow you anywhere you go!

140
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,081
And it will also slice through anything!

141
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,097
Hmph! | see through your strategy!

142
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,558
You're going to come toward me,
turning away at the last second,

143
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,063
to try to get it to hit me, right?!

144
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,773
Do you think I'm going to fall
for a two-bit tactic like that?!

145
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,241
Come on!

146
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,504
Gotcha!

147
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,798
Over here, Freeza!

148
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,019
Hmph, an afterimage, huh?

149
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,069
Not too shabby, monkey.

150
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:57,445
Sure enough, I have absolutely
no desire to fight you now.

151
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,244
Not if you're pinning your hopes
on a bush-league move like that.

152
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,743
If you really want to settle this,

153
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,543
build up your strength again,
and hone your skills some more.

154
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:13,756
A bush-league move, is it?

155
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:45,497
Goku! There's no time!
Planet Namek is going to explode!

156
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:59,837
Father!!

157
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,849
M-My technique is a bush-league move, is it?

158
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,568
Then how about two of them?!

159
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,778
You just don't get it.

160
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:41,302
Monkey, those will follow you
no matter where you go!

161
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,551
You think you can get away
from them? You'll be cut to pieces!

162
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,942
Freeza, you never learn!

163
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,990
Hmph! The same pattern, huh?
You've got no style!

164
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,126
Damn it! lam not falling for that childish trick!

165
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,294
Where are you, you simian bastard?!

166
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,105
You're no match for me!

167
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,086
I will not be shown up by any simian bastard!

168
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,380
Don't get up! Stay down!

169
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,800
l-lt can't be...!

170
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,516
K-Kaio-sama, what is the matter?

171
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,770
D-Don't tell us Goku has lost!

172
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,942
F-Freeza has been...

173
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,270
...cut in half...

174
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,909
The endgame is at hand.

175
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

176
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,413
