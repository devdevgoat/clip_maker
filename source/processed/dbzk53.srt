2
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:05,120
An unexpected conclusion laid in store

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:10,174
for the final showdown on Planet Namek.

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,185
Don't get up!

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,977
|-|t can't be...!

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,198
The Genki Dama bursts away

9
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,621
Go Go Let's do it

10
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:48,626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

11
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:54,586
I won't hold back, just you watch

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,550
l'll protect you with my life

13
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:06,731
Turn your courage to love into strength

14
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:12,733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

15
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:19,991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

16
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

17
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

18
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:33,128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

19
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

21
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:46,475
Your soul already knows the answer

22
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,183
Dragon Soul!

23
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:59,610
"Son Goku's Final Attack...
Planet Namek Passes On into Space. "

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,393
Sure, you may have brought that upon yourself,

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,267
but it ain't like you to meet
such a miserable end.

26
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,519
I'll get back to Earth somehow.

27
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:41,575
You'll share the same fate as the
planet that you yourself destroyed.

28
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,968
Help...

29
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,348
H-Help...

30
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:16,440
H-Help... m-me...

31
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:27,371
Goku, what are you waiting for?
Get out of there, now!

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,961
P-Please... h-h...

33
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,545
...help... me...!

34
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,016
Help...

35
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,348
Help... me...!

36
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,479
It's always about you!

37
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,607
How many... How many people have you killed

38
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,280
as they begged for their lives,
like you're doing?!

39
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,485
Please... help me...!

40
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,947
Please...!

41
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,329
Freeza...

42
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,010
I've shared a small amount of my Ki with you.

43
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:37,350
You should be able to get around
well enough, even in your shape.

44
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,526
You can manage the rest on your own!

45
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,645
This is unexpected.

46
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,898
Y-You, sharing your energy with me...

47
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,695
...you simian bastard...!

48
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,741
You can survive in the vacuum of space, right?

49
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,662
Then hurry up and get off of this planet.

50
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:36,037
Live on, and fully realize how precious life is!

51
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,802
P-Planet Namek here is just
moments from exploding.

52
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,148
Where do you think you're going?

53
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:08,107
No matter what you do, you can't
live in the vacuum of space.

54
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,113
Death is all that awaits you.

55
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,503
There's no more time before it explodes!

56
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,673
You don't have any time to
make it back to your spaceship!

57
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,255
And Vegeta has wrecked
the spaceship that I came in.

58
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,102
You Saiyans really are simian bastards!

59
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,057
You can't get off of this planet!

60
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,234
You're going to perish, right along with it!

61
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,485
How ironic. You, who won the fight, will die,

62
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,907
while I will be spared!

63
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,863
Th-That's what you get for being so insolent

64
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,870
as to share your energy with me, Freeza.

65
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,667
|'|| survive, just you watch.

66
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,135
I'm calling it.

67
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,713
W-What?

68
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,221
W-What do you mean, you're calling it?

69
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,270
I'm beginning to think there ain't
no reason to fight you no further.

70
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:25,101
You should go on living with
that shock, quietly, in obscurity.

71
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,699
S-Simian bastard...!

72
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,957
lam the greatest in the universe!

73
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:48,586
lam the cosmic emperor, Freeza!

74
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,919
Th-That's why you...

75
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,504
...you simian bastard...

76
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,467
...must die by my hand!

77
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,895
Y-You...

78
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,609
...deserve...

79
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,406
...deserve...

80
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,826
...to be killed by me!

81
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:23,576
You dumbass!!

82
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,087
Here...

83
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,961
Th-Thank you.

84
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,213
Wait up!

85
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,172
Up here!

86
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,570
It appears that my time is almost here.

87
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,696
G-Grand Elder!

88
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,162
G-Grand Elder...!

89
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,539
--Grand Elder!
--Grand Elder!

90
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,582
Grand Elder!

91
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,711
G-Gather... Gather everyone here.

92
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,337
Right!

93
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,843
--Grand Elder!
--Grand Elder!

94
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:50,268
It would seem that the time has
come for me to take my leave.

95
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:55,694
|-| am glad that l was able to live a full life.

96
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,913
Muri-sama!

97
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,991
Yes, what did you find?

98
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:13,704
Sure enough, we cannot locate
anyone from Elder Tsuno's village.

99
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,050
What could have become of them?

100
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,548
Those are probably the guys
from the village that l wiped out.

101
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,254
The wish to the Dragon Balls
was to bring back to life

102
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,889
everyone that was killed by
Freeza and his men, right?

103
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,518
Hmph, I am not one of Freeza's men.
Botched that one up, huh?

104
00:11:54,214 --> 00:12:02,383
Oh, the Dragon Balls appear...
to have followed us here.

105
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,842
G-Grand Elder...!

106
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:16,859
A-As I said earlier, my time is now all but up.

107
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,856
M-Muri...

108
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,983
Y-Yes?

109
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,032
Hold... Hold out your hand.

110
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,700
Right.

111
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:39,923
F-From here on, you will be the Grand Elder.

112
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:46,096
l-ln time, the Dragon Balls will
once again regain their brilliance.

113
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:50,346
Use the Dragon Balls well.

114
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,395
Y-Yes, as you wish.

115
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,314
|-| leave you to it.

116
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,766
Grand Elder!

117
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:04,357
P-Peace on Namek, forever...

118
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,193
Grand Elder!

119
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,906
Grand Elder...

120
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,289
G-Grand Elder...

121
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,166
G... Grand Elder...

122
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:39,353
Grand Elder, may you rest in peace.

123
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,025
|-| now understand clearly, Piccolo-san.

124
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,202
You merged with Nail-san, didn't you?

125
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,491
G-Guys!

126
00:13:55,585 --> 00:14:00,625
The Grand Elder is now gone.
Let those of us who are left behind

127
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,922
join together to usher in an everlasting peace!

128
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,374
--Right!
--|ndeed!

129
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,302
The Grand Elder has passed away,

130
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,800
and Kuririn-kun won't be
coming back, either, huh?

131
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,133
No. Someone who has been
returned to life with the Dragon Balls

132
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,139
cannot be brought back a second time.

133
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,312
Eh? It's all right!

134
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,357
Namek's Dragon Balls can
restore life again and again!

135
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,652
As long as it wasn't a natural death,
there's probably no limit.

136
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,275
So then... then...

137
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,153
Dende, when the day comes that
we can have our wishes granted

138
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,828
by your Dragon Balls again, we can
bring Kuririn-san, Chaozu-san,

139
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,405
and the others back to life, too!

140
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,038
Father, be sure you come back!

141
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,540
Let's call back Kuririn-san together,

142
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,464
using Planet Namek's Dragon Balls!

143
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,530
Kaio-sama, just what is going on?

144
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,907
What's happening to Goku and Freeza?

145
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,375
Freeza is dead.

146
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,717
As Freeza begged for his life,

147
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,884
Son Goku shared some of his Ki with him,

148
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,963
giving him a chance to live, but he...

149
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:38,848
Freeza used it to attack Goku.

150
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,147
And so, Goku had no choice
but to finish him off.

151
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,351
Then, Goku's victory is complete!

152
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:53,033
Mm-hmm, Freeza was no match for Goku,
once he became a Super Saiyan.

153
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,859
He did it!

154
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:01,283
That's how incredible a Super Saiyan is?

155
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,414
That means Goku's strength
is the greatest in the universe.

156
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:09,044
It seems like he's become
someone from a world far away.

157
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,218
However... However...

158
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:17,095
...he may only be the best in
the universe for a brief moment.

159
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,971
How so?

160
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:23,681
Planet Namek's explosion is closing in.

161
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:28,769
There isn't time for Goku to
reach the spaceship he came in.

162
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:33,106
He is headed for Freeza's
spaceship, which is nearby,

163
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,864
but it appears to be broken down, as well.

164
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,041
H-Hey, this is Goku. I'm sure
he'll scrape through somehow.

165
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:51,249
I mean, he's gotten out of
pinches like this time and again.

166
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,587
Besides, right now, Goku is
a Super Saiyan. Am I right?

167
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,764
Y-Yeah!

168
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,308
Goku, hurry! Just hurry!

169
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,939
All right!

170
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,706
Please, let me be in time!

171
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,713
Where's the control room?!

172
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:53,153
All right, good! It's almost the
same as the spaceship I came in!

173
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,276
Where's the takeoff button?!

174
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,903
Here!

175
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,830
Start up!

176
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,953
Please, start up!

177
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:15,842
Start up! Start up, damn it!
Start up! Start up!

178
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,600
Start up! Start up! Start up! Start up!

179
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,176
How can this be...? How can this--

180
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,005
What happened, Kaio-sama?!

181
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,684
His last remaining hope, Freeza's spaceship...

182
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,683
...has been swallowed up by lava...!

183
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,436
So then, what about Goku-san?

184
00:19:54,527 --> 00:20:00,238
He can't make it back. All he can
do is share Planet Namek's fate.

185
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,013
It's going to explode.
Planet Namek is going to explode.

186
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,732
Damn it all!!

187
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,821
I can't watch!

188
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,869
Goku...

189
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,699
Goku... Don't you die...

190
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,081
Don't you die!!

191
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:08,557
Damn it all!!

192
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:21,983
Damn it all!!

193
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

194
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,413
Fly away into the boundless skies

195
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

196
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,463
and zip away to wherever we want

197
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,806
Being a daredevil is the best

198
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

199
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:57,101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

200
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:03,278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

201
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

202
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,865
You were born

203
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:16,575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

204
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

205
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,789
Go at it full power

206
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,842
Hope is my weapon,

207
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,171
so believe in the future

208
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,268
Yo, it's Yamucha!

209
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,846
Bulma, I want you to keep calm and listen to me.

210
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,603
Goku is... Goku is dead.

211
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:46,028
Hey, everyone! Word is that
Son-kun died. That's a shocker, huh?

212
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:50,028
Y-You dumbass! How can you put it like that?!

213
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,734
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

214
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,663
"Goku Vanishes into Space...
Back to Life, Super Warriors!”

215
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,163
Huh? Son-kun can't be brought back to life?
