00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:08,502
Goku had finally achieved victory. However...

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:20,218
Damn it all!!

4
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,304
Is Son Goku dead?

"Goku Vanishes into Space...
Back to Life, Super Warriors!”

23
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,247
Kaio-sama...

24
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,249
Is Goku really...?

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,983
Sure enough, there's no hope.

26
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,783
Damn it! Goku!

27
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,485
He really is dead, then?

28
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,581
What a shame.

29
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:53,538
We'll have to inform Goku's son
on Earth of his father's death.

30
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,293
This will be hard on him.

31
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,626
What if we have Bulma-san tell him?

32
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,847
All right.

33
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,343
Please, let me be the one to tell her.

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,810
Okay then, Yamucha.

35
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,388
Well then, if you would...

36
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,939
Right.

37
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,114
Bulma... Bulma, can you hear me?

38
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,120
Bulma...

39
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,655
Can you hear me, Bulma?

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,251
It's me, Yamucha.

41
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,872
Huh? Yamucha?

42
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,919
That's right. It's Yamucha.

43
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:39,171
I'm speaking directly into
your mind through Kaio-sama.

44
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,967
Into my mind?

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,260
ReaHy?

46
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:47,467
What is it, Bulma-san?
By any chance, is that Kaio-sama?

47
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,974
That's what he said.
I'm impressed that you knew.

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,441
Yamucha is the one speaking right now.

49
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,481
So, are you doing well, Yamucha?

50
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,983
Mm-hmm. lam still dead,
but I'm doing fine, otherwise.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,861
But never mind me, I want you
to keep calm and listen to me.

52
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,534
It's about Goku.

53
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:11,332
Goku defeated Freeza. B-But then...

54
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:17,163
Hey, everyone, listen up! He says
that Son-kun has taken down Freeza!

55
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:22,172
Really, Bulma-san? Hooray! Hooray!

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,638
Hooray! Hooray!

57
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:28,091
He has, huh? Son, you finally did it.

58
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,178
Father has won! He won!

59
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,852
Freeza, beaten by Kakarrot?

60
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,982
Be quiet and listen to me.
There's more than just that.

61
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,280
After he defeated Freeza, Goku...

62
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,323
...desperately tried to get away, but...

63
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,153
...he didn't make it before
Planet Namek exploded...

64
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,533
...and he died.

65
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,115
Hey, hold up, everyone.

66
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,498
He says that Son-kun died
when Planet Namek exploded.

67
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,419
That's a shocker, huh?

68
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,044
You dumbass! How can you put it like that?!

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,625
Think about Gohan, will you?!

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,211
Goku can never come back again!

71
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,427
You don't know what's what.

72
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,556
We have the Dragon Balls from Planet Namek.

73
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:18,482
The Dragon Balls came to Earth
together with the Namekians.

74
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,479
This will surprise you!

75
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,107
They say that the Namekian Dragon Balls

76
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:27,111
can bring people back
to life over and over again!

77
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,950
In other words, Son-kun,
Kuririn-kun, and Chaozu-kun

78
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,160
can all come back to life again.

79
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,995
l-ls that right?!

80
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,580
What is it, Yamucha?

81
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:46,590
We're all coming back to life!
Including you, Chaozu.

82
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,715
ReaHy?

83
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,924
It's the folks on Earth who
don't know what's what.

84
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,227
Sure, Chaozu can be brought back to life

85
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,100
with the Namekian Dragon Balls.

86
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,807
But as for Goku and Kuririn...

87
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,484
What about Goku and Kuririn, Kaio-sama?

88
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:08,987
The Dragon Balls bring the dead
back to life where they died.

89
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,692
Which means...?

90
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,575
Goku and Kuririn would come
back to life on Planet Namek.

91
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,454
However, Planet Namek is no longer there!

92
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,789
It's now just the vacuum of space.

93
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,877
Death would be waiting for them
the moment they returned to life.

94
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,900
Kaio-sama, with your power,
can't you... can't you do anything?

95
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:48,356
I can do nothing. That place
is not under myjurisdiction.

96
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:56,280
H-He says that Son-kun... can't come back.

97
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,239
O-Oh, no...!

98
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:17,767
W-Why is it that Father and
Kuririn-san can't come home alive?

99
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,231
It sounds like if Kami-sama
regenerated your body,

100
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,475
like in Chaozu-kun's case,

101
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,558
and you're there at
Kaio-sama's place, you'd be fine,

102
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:28,521
but otherwise, you come back
to life wherever you died.

103
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:33,530
But Son-kun and Kuririn-kun
died on Planet Namek, and...

104
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,531
Planet Namek isn't there anymore, right?

105
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,829
It's just the vacuum of space.

106
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,908
What's more, apparently,
Kaio-sama isn't in charge

107
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,084
of the area where Planet Namek is.

108
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,287
O-Oh, no...

109
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,927
Why don't you try using
your heads for a minute?

110
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,096
You can just relocate their souls,

111
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,721
or whatever they are, here to Earth,
and then revive them, right?

112
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,143
More than likely.

113
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,186
Yeah! He's right!

114
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,141
That's a pretty good idea you had, isn't it?

115
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,645
Thank you very much.

116
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,942
Don't get carried away.

117
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,498
Ijust want to see Kakarrot,
now that he's a Super Saiyan.

118
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:26,124
And then, someday, I'll beat him. I swear it!

119
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,706
E-Excuse me, my earthling friend...

120
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,385
Once the Dragon Balls of Namek are restored,

121
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,599
we plan to locate a suitable
world and relocate there.

122
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,423
Could you direct us to a place

123
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,102
where we can spend our time until then?

124
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,554
Well, okay.

125
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,481
In that case, you can stay at my home.

126
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,433
Are you sure about that?

127
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,484
It's a huge place, so no problem.

128
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,942
Besides, we'd like to make use of
your Dragon Balls a little bit more.

129
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,286
Do it! Right, Dende-kun?

130
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,533
Sure...

131
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,241
If this many of you are
spotted loitering around,

132
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,543
it will create a huge uproar.

133
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,964
That's true enough.
Okay, we'll take you up on it.

134
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,632
How about you coming, too?

135
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,552
After all, you've got no hotel money, right?

136
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,721
l'll feed you plenty.

137
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,846
I'll bet you're just like Son-kun,
and eat like crazy, right?

138
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:27,477
But no matter how attractive I
might be, no hanky panky, okay?

139
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,810
V-Vulgar woman! Keep your voice down.

140
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,271
Okay, everyone, sit tight for a minute.

141
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,483
I'll go hunt down a phone
somewhere and have my dad come.

142
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,364
U-Um, Bulma-san...

143
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,414
Could I maybe stay over at
your place, too, Bulma-san?

144
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,617
Gohan-kun, you have your
own house, don't you?

145
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,125
You should go home. Your mother
must be worried about you.

146
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,502
Yeah, well, you see...

147
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,804
| forgot to do my homework...
and Mother will be angry with me.

148
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,971
Faster! Faster! Doesn't this
thing have more speed?!

149
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,805
Aw, geez...

150
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,858
Ah, he's here! He's here, he's here!

151
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,654
Here we are! Here! Here! Here we are!

152
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,331
Gohan-chan!

153
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,875
Where is Gohan-chan?!

154
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,128
Gohan-chan!

155
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,751
Mother, I'm home.

156
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:44,183
And so, the Namekians were
taken to the Capsule Corporation.

157
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,480
This is my home. What do you think?
Pretty cushy place, huh?

158
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,648
Is that...?

159
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:56,946
And so, the Namekians ended
up staying at Bulma's home

160
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,524
until the Dragon Balls became reactivated.

161
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,987
And then, in no time at all,
130 days had passed.

162
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,547
Wow. The Namekian Dragon Balls
reactivate after only 130 days, huh?

163
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:24,097
That's right. A Namekian
year is 130 days, after all.

164
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,927
That's about one-third of what
it is on Earth. Nice, isn't it?

165
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,728
Well, let's make our wishes to
Super Shen Long, right away.

166
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,978
J-Just a minute. Gohan isn't here yet.

167
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,526
Hey! Hold up a sec!

168
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,729
--Hey, Gohan!
--Hey, Gohan!

169
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,111
Sorry, my cram school ran a little long.

170
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,490
You're going to cram school
again? What a little trooper.

171
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,572
I want to have my Gohan-chan study like crazy,

172
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,749
so he'll end up becomin' a great scholar.

173
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,248
Well, we were just about to get started.

174
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,580
Okay, Dende-kun, if you please.

175
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,175
Right.

176
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,845
Takkaraputo Poppolunga pupirito paro!

177
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,187
Whoo! Whoo!

178
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,551
So this is the original Shen Long...

179
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,095
Wow, this is incredible!

180
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,718
Oh, my!

181
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,681
Thou who hast gathered
the seven Dragon Balls,

182
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,937
I shall grant thee any three wishes.

183
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,690
My earthling friend, we can go next time.

184
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,194
Go ahead and have your wishes granted.

185
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,277
Thank you very much, Grand Elder.

186
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,157
All right then, we'll make our wishes.

187
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,660
First, summon the souls
of Son Goku and Kuririn,

188
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,583
who died on Planet Namek, to come here.

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,879
Napahito sonda bakuli Iepicatto sopaIetto!

190
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,083
Understood. I shall try.

191
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,974
l have called hither the soul
of the one called Kuririn.

192
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,525
However, I cannot call forth the
soul of the one called Son Goku.

193
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,275
Huh? O-Oh, no! Why not?

194
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:50,952
Because Son Goku is alive.
I cannot call forth only his soul.

195
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,329
H-H-He's alive?

196
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,125
W-What?

197
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,545
H-He couldn't be. How?

198
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,918
--Yay! Yay!
--Yay! Yay!

199
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,170
Hooray!

200
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,843
If he's alive, I wonder why he hasn't come home.

201
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,301
His spaceship is probably
damaged or something.

202
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,980
Oh, in that case, you can ask
Polunga to summon him here.

203
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,932
Yeah, right!

204
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,563
Yay!

205
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,895
Okay then, first, the second wish.

206
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:30,200
--Go on! Go on!
--Bring Kuririn back to life.

207
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:35,451
Papitto Iatonguge Kuririn barsatto!

208
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,462
H-Huh?

209
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,548
Kuririn-san!

210
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,975
O-Oh, right. I've come back to life.

211
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,099
--Hooray!
--Yay! Yay!

212
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,522
As a special deal,

213
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,976
I have restored his dismembered
body to its original form.

214
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:09,360
You may have a stern face,
but you do good work, don't you?

215
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,155
Now then, finally,

216
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,488
pick up Son-kun and deliver him here!

217
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,040
--Hooray!
--Yay! Yay!

218
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:24,338
Hirokelotto deliba milocasuta pippo!

219
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,142
Goku-sa...

220
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,721
I cannot.

221
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,148
I have been denied.

222
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:52,567
The man named Son says that he
will return on his own in due time.

223
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,742
D-Denied? But why?

224
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,660
I know why!

225
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,706
He's afraid of his wife!
The strongest one in the universe

226
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,876
is Super Saiyan Son Goku's wife!

227
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,798
J-Joking! I'm joking!

228
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,968
F-Father isn't coming back?

229
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,218
He said he would come back
on his own in due time.

230
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,050
He's definitely coming home.

231
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,477
Iget it. He's training on another planet,

232
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,431
with plans to power up even more.

233
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,483
I can't just stick around here,
spinning my wheels!

234
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,955
Oh, dear...

235
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,833
Pay him no mind.

236
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,165
Keep going. Instead of Son,

237
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,467
bring back to life someone at Kaio's place.

238
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,797
Yeah, right. I wonder who we should ask for.

239
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,845
They say they want to call one of you back.

240
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,894
What should we do?

241
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,848
I want to train here for a little while longer.

242
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,776
I-I'd like to stay with Ten-san.

243
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,945
Okay then, Yamucha, you're the one to go.

244
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,950
Me first, huh? Sorry, guys.

245
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,743
All right. Well then...

246
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:23,119
Bulma... Bulma...

247
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,168
Bulma, it's me. Do you know who I am?

248
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,290
Kaio-sama?

249
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,623
Tenshinhan and Chaozu will be
staying over here a little longer.

250
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,255
Bring Yamucha back to life.

251
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,677
Yamucha, huh? Okay.

252
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,801
All right, the third wish. Once more, please!

253
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,883
Bring Yamucha back to life!

254
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,436
Pipatto dominori keludemine coaIutto!

255
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,607
All right, understood.

256
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:58,616
I have brought the man
called Yamucha back to life.

257
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,696
--Where? Huh? W-Where is he?
--Where? Where?

258
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,999
I have now granted all of thy wishes. Farewell!

259
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,293
J-Just a minute!

260
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:31,065
Aw, he's gone. Where is Yamucha?

261
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,892
Over here!

262
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,737
Ribbit-ribbit!

263
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,232
Yamucha-sama!

264
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,613
--Ribbit... ribbit...
--Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

265
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,319
Pu-erh...

266
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,870
Yamucha...

267
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,575
As long as you were going to bring me back,

268
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,412
I wish you could have picked a better spot.

269
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:03,594
And so, another 130 days passed.

270
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,891
With the first wish, Chaozu...

271
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,686
--Yahoo!
--Welcome home!

272
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:17,191
...and with the second wish,
Tenshinhan came back to life.

273
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,235
Ten-san...

274
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,699
--Ten-san! Ten-san!
--Chaozu...

275
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,509
And then...

276
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,586
Okay, Dende, it's time for us to take our leave.

277
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,137
R-Right.

278
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,808
Thank you very much, everyone.

279
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,430
T-Take care, okay?

280
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:57,269
Gohan-san, goodbye.
I've really enjoyed myself.

281
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,029
Dende...?

282
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,782
Dende...

283
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,244
Picoleto camuleo zecanpile...

284
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,577
I shall grant that wish.

285
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,429
Goodbye.

286
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,389
Goodbye...

287
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,402
Goodbye!

288
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,525
G—G...

289
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,111
Goodbye...

290
00:20:54,545 --> 00:21:01,792
With the third wish, the Namekians
moved to another world.

291
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,722
Let's see...

292
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,147
And so, for a short while,

293
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:29,281
the peace on Earth continued. However...

294
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

295
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,413

299
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

300
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:57,101
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

309
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,982
It's been a year now, but still,
Father has not returned home.

310
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,650
I wonder if he really is afraid of Mother.

311
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,696
Hey, Gohan, there's an evil Ki approaching!

312
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,990
This Ki couldn't belong to Freeza, could it?!

313
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,863
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

314
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,446
"That There Is Earth, Papa...
Freeza and Father Strike Back. ”

315
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,033
Goku, I thought you finished him off!
